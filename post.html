                        <H2>DEMO</H2>
                        <p>demo: Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet, in which there is no center because every point, or none, is center — an equal earth which all men occupy as equals. The airman's earth, if free men make it, will be truly round: a globe in practice, not in theory.</p>
                        <p>Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be used for both good and evil. But there's no turning back from science. The early warnings about technological dangers also come from science.</p>
                        <p>What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set foot on the Moon but that they set eye on the earth.</p>
                        <p>A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators. That's how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not help but love and cherish her.</p>
                        <p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>
                        <p>For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than those which divide us.</p>
                        <blockquote class="blockquote">The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.</blockquote>

                        <h3>1. Why Ultralearning?</h3>
                        <p><b>Learning is the foundation for success in nearly every aspect of life.</b></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b style="color:blue;">you start in school.</b><br>
                                Clearly learning matters here – learning well allows you to get good grades, get accepted to the best schools and graduate without the grind. Then you start work. Learning becomes a path to improvement – it gives you valuable skills so you can be a leader instead of just another cog in the system.
                            </li>
                            <br>

                            <li><b style="color:blue;">Learning matters for your health.</b><br>
                                You need to learn what to eat, how to work out and how to maintain good habits. Learning matters for your relationships. Learning how people are, the best way to build connections and deepen them. Learning defines how you see yourself in the world, your sense of purpose in life and meaning.
                                <br>Given that learning underlies so much of life, why not start with learning how to learn better?
                            </li>
                            <br>

                            <li><b style="color:blue;">Ultralearning is my approach to learning things well.</b><br>
                            There’s no one exact method for ultralearning, but there are some common principles amongst all ultralearners:<br>
                            1.   <b>Self-education. </b> if you’re in school, a self-education mindset puts you in the driver’s seat, controlling how and
                            4what you learn. Ultralearners don’t passively absorb education, they create it.<br>
                            2.   <b>Deep focus.</b> Ultralearning isn’t a passive task. It demands hard, intense focus. The rewards for this effort, however, are large and it allows ultralearners to quickly develop skills that other people spend years unable to get a grasp on.<br>
                            3.   <b>Scientifically informed.</b> Ultralearners don’t treat learning as a mystery. Instead, they use the best available understanding of the science of memory and skill-aquisition to use an approach that makes learning anything a step-bystep process.<br>
                            Ultralearning takes many forms, and the best way to recognize it is to first see some examples, so I’ll start by sharing my ultralearning projects, then move to explaining how you can start your own.<br></p>

                        <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

                        <p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>
                        <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
